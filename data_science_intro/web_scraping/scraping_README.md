# Web Scraping

This explains some the sibling and child directories of `dsa/data_science_intro/web_scraping`.

## Siblings
The BBC scraper is a basic scraper of the BBC front page. It does some rudimentary topic analysis by counting the nouns that show up in the stories of the front page.

## Scrapy
The projects in the scraping directory all use the scrapy Python library. Scrapy is a web scraping framework that includes an interactive shell and API.

Two of the projects, books_crawler and quotes_spider collect information over multiple pages from toy static sites.

Three others scrape information from real world websites, including Class Central, craigslist and DataCamp. Each spider collects information from multiple pages.
