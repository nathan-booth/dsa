# Documentation

## Purpose

In software development contexts, documentation is meant to offer instructions on how to use software.
In data science contexts, documentation describes and explains where data comes from, how it is cleaned and the choices made in an analysis.

Good documentation is easy to read and understand. Good documentation lowers the barrier to understanding the code or makes an analysis repeatable and replicable.

Bad documentation forces a reader to reverse engineer code to understand the writer's thought process. This limits the number of people who will attempt to use the code. Practice computational kindness by making code easy to understand.

You use your own documentation too. If you think past to previous projects you may have done, you may notice gaps in what your remember or what you were thinking at the time you made a certain decision. That's what documentation is for. It helps you make sense of your past actions.

## Anatomy of Documentation

Typical features:
* title
* labels
* concise introduction of what software is
* installation instructions
* a basic use example
* version information
* background information
* how to contribute
* license

Include **essential** information. What exactly that is varies from project to project. Good questions to start your thinking include:
* what steps need to be taken to run/use this?
* what should the user already have installed or configured?
* what might they find difficult to understand at the start?

[Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/) for your documentation.

As your codebase grows, you may need to add more sections:
* known bugs
* FAQ
* table of contents

## Markdown

It's a useful language for doing simple formatting. Check [this reference](https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
